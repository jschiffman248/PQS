## What Is an Amazon Scraping API?

Amazon scraping APIs act like remote servers that help you gather data from Amazon. The process is straightforward: you send a request to the API endpoint containing the target URL and parameters (e.g., location). The API then retrieves the necessary data for you.

These APIs use anti-detection methods to avoid being blocked, ensuring you get the data you need. While most general-purpose scraping APIs can handle Amazon, some specialized APIs are designed to parse e-commerce pages and extract only the relevant data points.
