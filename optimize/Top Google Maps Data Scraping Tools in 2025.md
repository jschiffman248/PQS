## Is Scraping Google Maps Legal?

### Understanding Google's Terms of Service and Potential Risks

Scraping publicly available data from Google Maps is generally legal. However, Google's terms of service explicitly prohibit unauthorized automated access to its platform. Violating these terms may result in penalties, such as account suspension or legal action. To avoid these risks, you should use tools that comply with Google's guidelines and focus on collecting non-restricted data.

> **Pro Tip**: Always review Google Maps' terms of use and Robots.txt file before starting any scraping activity. This ensures you operate within legal boundaries.

## Google Maps Scraping Tools vs. Google Maps API
