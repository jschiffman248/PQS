## Scraping Instagram: API vs. Web Scraping

To extract data from Instagram, you can use either the **Instagram API** or **web scraping**. Letâ€™s explore the pros and cons of each method.

### Instagram API Scraping
The Instagram API provides structured access to public data. While itâ€™s a great way to ingest data, its limitations include:

- Requires an **access token**, which can take weeks to obtain.
- Limited data access â€“ restricted profiles, no posts, etc.
- Frequent changes that may break your setup.

### Web Scraping Instagram
Web scraping, on the other hand, allows you to extract more data by mimicking a userâ€™s actions. Here are its strengths and challenges:

| **Aspect**            | **Pros**                          | **Cons**                          |
|------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Data Access**        | Access more data                 | HTML parsing complexity           |
| **Authentication**     | No access token required         | Lower rate limits                 |
| **Flexibility**        | Significantly more robust options | Requires block avoidance tactics  |

For greater flexibility and scale, web scraping is often the better choice, though it requires more engineering effort.

### Hybrid Approach
For best results, combine **API scraping** for structured data and **web scraping** for additional data like posts and stories.

num_scrolls = 10
for i in range(num_scrolls):
    driver.execute_script('window.scrollTo(0, document.body.scrollHeight);')
    time.sleep(3)

followers = driver.find_element_by_xpath('//a[@href="/cristiano/followers/"]/span').text
