### FAQs

#### **Is ScrapeNinja better than Chrome scraping extensions?**  
Yes! While Chrome extensions work for light scraping, cloud-based solutions like ScrapeNinja are better suited for heavy-duty tasks and scalable performance.

#### **Why not use Puppeteer/Selenium for scraping?**  
While Puppeteer and Selenium offer flexibility, they are slow and resource-intensive for large-scale scraping. ScrapeNinja provides an efficient alternative with real Chrome evaluation via the `/scrape-js` endpoint.

#### **How does ScrapeNinja compare to BrightData?**  
BrightData is a powerful player, but its pricing can quickly add up. ScrapeNinja offers a cost-effective alternative for high-quality scraping without breaking the bank.
