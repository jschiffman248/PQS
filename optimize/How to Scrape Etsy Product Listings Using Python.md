## Why Scrape Etsy?

Etsyâ€™s product listings contain a wealth of information, including:

- **Product Titles:** Useful for categorizing and identifying items.
- **Prices:** Helpful for price trend analysis and competitive pricing.
- **Descriptions:** Provide insights into product details.
- **Seller Information:** Helps understand market dynamics and seller trends.
- **Ratings and Reviews:** Assess product quality and reputation.

Manually collecting this data can be time-consuming, which is where web scraping comes in handy.

## Setting Up Your Environment

Before starting, you'll need to set up your tools and environment:

### Step 1: Install Python and Required Libraries

Ensure Python is installed on your system. Youâ€™ll also need the following Python libraries:

- **Crawlbase Python Library:** For making HTTP requests using the Crawlbase Crawling API.
  ```bash
  pip install crawlbase
  ```
- **Beautiful Soup 4:** For parsing HTML content.
  ```bash
  pip install beautifulsoup4
  ```
- **Pandas:** For storing and manipulating the scraped data.
  ```bash
  pip install pandas
  ```

### Step 2: Choose Your IDE

Here are some recommended Integrated Development Environments (IDEs):

- [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/): Great for robust Python development.
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/): Versatile and lightweight with extensive plugins.
- [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/): Ideal for interactive coding and data visualization.

### Step 3: Sign Up for Crawlbase Crawling API

1. Visit the [Crawlbase website](https://crawlbase.com/signup) and create an account.
2. Retrieve your API token from the Crawlbase dashboard.
3. Use the JavaScript token for Etsy, as it heavily relies on dynamic content.

## Understanding Etsy's Website Structure

Before writing the scraper, it's essential to understand Etsy's page structure:

- **Search Bar:** Input field for product queries.
- **Product Listings:** Contain titles, prices, ratings, and more.
- **Pagination:** Divides search results across multiple pages.

Use browser developer tools (right-click > Inspect) to analyze the HTML structure and identify CSS selectors for the elements you want to scrape.

## Scraping Etsy Product Listings

### Step 1: Crawl the Search Page HTML

The Crawlbase Crawling API simplifies scraping dynamic websites by handling JavaScript rendering and bypassing CAPTCHAs. Below is a script to retrieve the HTML of an Etsy search page:

```python
from crawlbase import CrawlingAPI

# Initialize the API
api = CrawlingAPI({'token': 'YOUR_CRAWLBASE_JS_TOKEN'})

# Define the search URL
search_url = 'https://www.etsy.com/search?q=handmade+jewelry'

# Request options
options = {
    'page_wait': 2000,
    'ajax_wait': 'true'
}

# Fetch the HTML
response = api.get(search_url, options)
if response['status_code'] == 200:
    html_content = response['body']
    print(html_content)
else:
    print("Failed to retrieve page.")
```

### Step 2: Extract Data with Beautiful Soup

Once you have the HTML, use Beautiful Soup to parse and extract product details:

```python
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

# Parse HTML with Beautiful Soup
soup = BeautifulSoup(html_content, 'html.parser')

# Find product containers
products = soup.select('div.v2-listing-card__info')

# Extract details
for product in products:
    title = product.select_one('h3.v2-listing-card__title').text.strip()
    price = product.select_one('span.currency-value').text.strip()
    print(f"Title: {title}, Price: {price}")
```

### Step 3: Handle Pagination

Etsy search results span multiple pages. To handle pagination:

1. Determine the total number of pages.
2. Iterate through each page, updating the URL with the page number.

```python
def get_total_pages(html):
    soup = BeautifulSoup(html, 'html.parser')
    pages = soup.select_one('nav.pagination li:nth-last-child(2) a').text
    return int(pages)

def scrape_all_pages():
    base_url = 'https://www.etsy.com/search?q=handmade+jewelry'
    total_pages = get_total_pages(html_content)
    for page in range(1, total_pages + 1):
        page_url = f'{base_url}&page={page}'
        # Repeat scraping process for each page
```

## Storing Scraped Data

### Option 1: Save to CSV

Using Pandas, you can save your data in a CSV file:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Example data
data = [{'title': 'Handmade Necklace', 'price': '25.00'}]

# Save to CSV
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
df.to_csv('etsy_products.csv', index=False)
```

### Option 2: Save to SQLite Database

For a more structured approach, store data in an SQLite database:

```python
import sqlite3

# Connect to database
conn = sqlite3.connect('etsy_products.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Create table
cursor.execute('''
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS products (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    title TEXT,
    price TEXT
)
''')

# Insert data
data = [('Handmade Necklace', '25.00')]
cursor.executemany('INSERT INTO products (title, price) VALUES (?, ?)', data)

conn.commit()
conn.close()
```
