### Fetching HTML with Crawlbase Crawling API

To retrieve Walmartâ€™s Best Sellers page, use the Crawlbase Crawling API. Here's an example for the **Electronics** category:

```javascript
const CrawlbaseClient = require('crawlbase-api-client');
const client = new CrawlbaseClient('YOUR_API_KEY_HERE');

client.crawl('https://www.walmart.com/shop/best-sellers/electronics', function(error, response) {
  if (error) {
    console.error('Error:', error);
  } else {
    console.log(response.body); // HTML content

### Extracting Key Data with JSON Parsing

To simplify data extraction, enable the **autoparse** feature of the Crawlbase Crawling API. This feature structures the data into JSON format, allowing you to focus on relevant details such as product names, prices, and ratings.

Example:

```javascript
client.crawl('https://www.walmart.com/shop/best-sellers/electronics', {
  autoparse: true
}, function(error, response) {
  if (error) {
    console.error('Error:', error);
  } else {
    console.log(response.json); // Parsed JSON data
  }
});
```

const $ = cheerio.load(htmlContent);

const products = [];

$('.product-container').each((index, element) => {
  const product = {
    name: $(element).find('.product-title').text().trim(),
    price: $(element).find('.product-price').text().trim(),
    rating: $(element).find('.rating').text().trim(),
